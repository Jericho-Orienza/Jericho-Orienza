Hi, I’m @Jericho-Orienza and I am an aspiring softwre developer. I made this Github account to document my journey from making small projects to much larger ones.
I am also interested in web development and game development but for now start small to build big! Learn more about me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/jericho-orienza/
and feel free to contact me there or at jkr.orienza@gmail.com. Thanks for reading!
